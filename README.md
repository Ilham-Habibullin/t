Telegram Client API (MTProto) to connect to Telegram and control a user programmatically.

This project is written in 100% Dart language. Over 120,000 lines of code is ported from C++ to Dart. No native binaries, no C++ builds, no bullshit.

## Features

* Supports Telegram API Layer 174.
* Serialize/Deserialize MTProto objects to binary format to be sent/received throught the transport protocol (TCP, HTTP).
